# cityfmcodetests

- Step 1: Open this project with Microsoft Visual Studio (or vscode)
- Step 2: Make a new .env file with the provided sample
- Step 3: insert the API (include /products), and token key
- Step 4: Run project, enjoy!

Why .env? Because we should not include the API and the key in the repository. Those are the things that need to be hiden, it is the purpose of this Back-end that not to expose the API.
